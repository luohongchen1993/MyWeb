I use this repo to store the code I played around when I read the book on Flasky Web Development.
Some code are copied from https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky.
Up to date I did a little bit twisting in the dead-simple "Text Mining" part, which came from my Python programming class homework, and I just tried to integrate it into this little web app.
